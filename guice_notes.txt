This "main" method introduces a fundamental concept of Guice: the Module. The Module is the basic unit of definition of bindings
(or wiring, as it’s known in Spring).Guice has adopted a code-first approach for dependency injection and management so
you won’t be dealing with a lot of XML out-of-the-box.
The dependency tree of Communication will be implicitly injected using a feature called just-in-time binding, provided
the classes have the default no-arg constructor. This has been a feature in Guice since inception and only available
in Spring since v4.3.
Binding is to Guice as wiring is to Spring. With bindings, you define how Guice is going to inject dependencies into a class.

Guice will implicitly inject some general purpose components like the Injector and an instance of java.util.Logger,
among others. You’ll notice we are using loggers all through the samples but you won’t find an actual binding for them.
